Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The user needs this application was designed to address was the need for a weight loss tracker to help keep users on track to their goals. The app was designed to store information and notify the user when they met their goals.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

4 screens in total were needed to produce a user-centered UI that made sense and was easy to navigate. These views were the sign in page, the sign up page, the main page, and the notify page. These pages all lead to each other when buttons were pressed, and were all made to be simple and easy to read and navigate for the user. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the process of coding the app through creating an intital design then implementing the design to the best of my ability. At first I had a switch to notify my users on the main page, but I realized this was to crowded, and created a different page for it. Applying the design then code strategy in the future can be used to create a more user friendly application, that achieves the goals of the application.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested my code was functional through running it on the Android Emulator and making changes when issues occured. This process revealed several system bugs, including button glitches, and lock files that I had to fix to create the application properly.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to innovate in my grid and notification pages, where there was not a lot of room and the grid initally would not render on the page. Thhis included me changing my layout and button functions and grid views, as they impeded my application from running correctly.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I believe my login pages were my best work, along with the notification switch, as learning how to change preferences after a button switch was difficult, along with using SQQLite as a datebase which I had never used before.
